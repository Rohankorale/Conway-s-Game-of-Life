# Conway-s-Game-of-Life
A project for simulating/playing the beautiful 'Game of Life!'


The 'Game of Life' or 'Life' is a cellular Automata formulated by the british mathematician John Conway. In simple words an automata is a machine/algorithm which is self-moving.
Once an inout is given, it keeps working automatically based on some pre-defined set of rules. On the same lines, cellular automata is an automata consisting of cellular grid 
where each cell is designated with a state (alive/dead), at a time(say t=0). Based on the rules, these cells change their states as time passes on. Jon Conway wanted to create
a unpredictable automation such that some cells would live for a long time before dying while other would go on living for forever (stable configurations). And he came up
with the 'Game of Life'
